# document-similarity
This project implements a document similarity model using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Users can input a folder path containing text documents, and the system calculates the similarity between them. It leverages libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas to efficiently read documents, vectorize text, and compute similarity scores.
